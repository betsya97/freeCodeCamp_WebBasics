<!-- therer arre  different keywords to use  for  "animation-timing-function: ease, which starts slow, speeds up in the middle,
and then slows down again in the end, ease-out which is quick in the beginning then slows down,
ease-in, which is slow in the beginning, then speeds up at the end, or
linear, which applies a constant animation speed throughout.-->
